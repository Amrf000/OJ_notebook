If you are working with Vue.js and SPA you are going to end up using [vue-router](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router) sooner or later to deal with the navigation of your app.

Why vue-router? Well, from my point of view, the answer is easy: vue-router is officially supported by the Vue.js team with all the benefits that come with that (support, documentation, simplicity, among others).

In their own words:

> “Creating a single-page application with Vue + Vue-Router is dead-simple.

In this blog, we are going to go through some of the most important things to take into consideration when working with vue-router, trying to explain them as clearly as possible, but we are not going to tackle everything… for more information, go to the [vue-router documentation](https://router.vuejs.org).

So, let’s start.

Installing Vue-Router
=====================

Let’s see two ways to get vue-router installed.

Direct download:

<script src=”https://unpkg.com/vue-router/dist/vue-router.js"></script>

Npm installation:

npm install vue-router

Usage when installing through npm and using a module system:

Simple Route Configuration
==========================

Let’s create two simple routes, one for home and another for about. First, we need to add the links to the HTML:

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/922/1*UgkawRsCUt7N6FeH5Ou1LA.png)

The `router-link` is what we use to generate the links, with `to` we set the path. The `router-view`, as the comment in the code says, is the place where the routed component is going to render.

Now, let’s create the configuration to handle these routes:

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*bo-QwxZZbcKrrOXkvDCvMQ.png?q=20)

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/371/1*bo-QwxZZbcKrrOXkvDCvMQ.png)

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/742/1*bo-QwxZZbcKrrOXkvDCvMQ.png)

First, we set a couple of Vue.js components (_Home_ and _About_) so we have something to bind the routes to.

Then, we create the routes object with three path configurations:

*   The first path (“`/`”), renders the `Home` component.
*   The second path (“`/home`”) redirects to “`/`” and renders the `Home` component.
*   The third path (“`about`”) renders the `About` component.

Now we can provide the `routes` object that we just configured to the `ViewRouter` instance.

Finally, we mount our `router` object into our root instance of Vue.js.

And that’s it, now you have a couple of simple navigation links working in your app.

Routing With Params
===================

Yeah, params! We love them, we want them… Let’s see how we can use them, taking the configuration that we already started setting.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/904/1*8Ltjyut3w9VGVpQgVTlvlg.png)

First, let’s add a route with a param called `name` to our `routes` object (“`/user/:name`”). Then we bind it to a component.

Finally, I’m setting props to `true` (not mandatory and `false` by default). By doing this, we are managing the params as props in the component to decouple our component from the `$route.prams` object.

If we don’t do this, we have to access the params through the object mentioned before in our component (not cool).

And with the approach mentioned before, this is how you deal with the params in your component. We can trigger this route or any route through links or programmatically.

Through links:

Programmatically:

Nested Routes
=============

In the words of the Vue.js team:

> “Real app UIs are usually composed of components that are nested multiple levels deep. It is also very common that the segments of a URL correspond to a certain structure of nested components.”

So, let’s see how to deal with nested rules. We are going to consider that inside the `users` component, we are going to have navigation to “`user/profile`” and “`user/posts`”:

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*T5JIE13D9nKtJ84ny9gfqA.png?q=20)

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1128/1*T5JIE13D9nKtJ84ny9gfqA.png)

Using the property children on the `route` object, we configure nested routing. The path we are setting runs under the path of the father, in this case “`/user/:name`”, and then we set the component to render under that route.

In the template of the component, let’s add the links and the render area:

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1394/1*11lKyMX5CfqhUhuxRHUUiQ.png)

And that’s it! Now you have nested routing working…

In the code shown in the image, you get to see something “strange” (… to give it a name), and I’m not talking about that ugly template.

The `to` value is obtained through a couple of functions and in those functions, I’m using the name param obtained in the user component from the `$route.params`.

It is one approach to creating the URL… You can use something else if you don’t like it, but remember to render the right URL including the name of the actual user (in this case).

Important Detail
================

When you are in a URL path and that path changes, the life cycle event of the component is not executed. The component is just updated using the same instance.

To re-instantiate the component, you can use two approaches.

1.  Using a watch:

2\. Using `beforeRouteUpdate`:

And that’s it! Now you have a good understanding of how to use vue-router. Quite simple, right?
